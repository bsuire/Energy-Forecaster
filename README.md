Energy-Forecaster
=================

This is the result of a 48-hour programming competition at McGill University the goal of which was to design an application that would use data provided by Pulse Energy in order to display both historical data and future energy trend predictions (made by the application).
This had to be done two ways, first visually which can be seen at energy-forecaster.rhcloud.com/pulseinterface and secondly as a text output from a cURL POST command to energy-forecaster.rhcloud.com/machineinterface.
